## OCT Volume Preprocessing

`oct_to_mat.m` is the **main function** used for preprocessing OCT volumes.

All other `.m` files are **auxiliary functions** required to run the preprocessing pipeline.  
These auxiliary functions and the file to be converted **must be located in the same directory** as `oct_to_mat.m` in order to work correctly.
